# Which Lambda runtime is faster? 

Node, Python, Go, Ruby, Java or .Net?

Which Lambda runtime is more performance consistent?

Which Lambda runtime has lower cold starts / freeze startup?

# Execution

To test lambda performance - I've implemented a simple Lambda application 
on all the runtimes (Golang, Python, Node, Java, Ruby, .Net).

All Lambda functions are connected to API Gateway and can be tested as REST API.

For runtimes Node, Python and Ruby - source code was copied from AWS Console sample functions.
For Java, Go and .Net - source code was written from scratch.
All implementations (on all languages) act the same - they just reply with text "Hello from Lambda!"

As a testing tool - was chosen Locust. Tth test file is located in ```locustfile.py```

The test was executed on AWS CodeBuild for 5 minutes. For the full results see section "Full results" below.

![Test setup diagram](setup_diagram.png?raw=true "Title")

This test will check how fast AWS can spin up Lambda functions in different runtimes.

For cold starts - be aware that it depends on the Lambda package size.
Package size for of this sample application:
- Node.js, Python, Ruby, Golang - 7.7Mb
- Java - 1Mb
- .Net - 82Kb

# Conclusion

In terms of performance **Go (Golang) runtime appeared to be the fastest**. 
Golang is 24% faster than average in this test. 
Also Golang appeared to be the most stable, with minimum cold starts.

The silver medal for performance took Python, and bronze - goes to Node.js**.

| Runtime  | Performance (top 80%) | Cold starts (top 99,9%) |  . |
|----------|--------- |--------------|-----------------------------------------|
| ðŸ¥‡ Golang   | 52ms ðŸ¥‡  |  170ms ðŸ¥‡    | Golang - best performance and stability |
| ðŸ¥ˆ Python   | 68ms ðŸ¥ˆ  |  190ms       | Python - golden middle |
| ðŸ¥‰ Node.js  | 75ms ðŸ¥‰  |  190ms       | Node.js - performance competing with Python |
| .Net     | 52ms ðŸ¥‡  |  730ms ðŸ’©ðŸ’©ðŸ’©| .Net - very fast but too many cold starts
| Java     | 65ms     |  510ms ðŸ’©ðŸ’©  | Java - many cold starts
| Ruby     | 79ms ðŸ’©  |  210ms       | Ruby - the slowest |

.Net has too many cold starts, despite being same fast as Golang.
Java also have a lot of cold starts.
And least performing appeared to be the Ruby runtime.

Based on this, Golang is the fastest Lambda runtime nowadays, followed by Node and Python, which are also OK.
While Java, .Net, and Ruby are either slow either have an unpredictable cold starts, 
so better stay away from these languages within Lambda environment.
